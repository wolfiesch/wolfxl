"""W4E.P5 regression: ``Hyperlink.is_internal`` is the source-of-truth flag.

Before the fix the emitter used ``target.starts_with('#')`` to decide
internal vs external. That worked for the happy path but had a footgun:
any caller that explicitly set ``internal=False`` while passing a
``target`` of ``"#anchor"`` (or just any payload that started with ``#``)
would be silently re-routed to the internal-location code path,
swallowing the relationship and producing a broken external link.

The fix moves routing to an explicit ``is_internal: bool`` field. These
tests pin the new contract:

1. URLs with ``#`` fragments stay external (the canonical bug example).
2. ``internal=True`` produces a ``location=`` attribute and zero rels.
3. ``internal=False`` produces an ``r:id=`` attribute and one external
   relationship.
4. Both backends agree on the wire format for an internal link.
