"""Pytest fixtures for the differential writer harness.

The session-scoped autouse fixture below forces ``WOLFXL_TEST_EPOCH=0`` so
ZIP entry mtimes are deterministic — without this, byte-level fixture
comparison is impossible (mtimes drift second-to-second).

Post-W5 the harness is single-backend: ``rust_xlsxwriter`` was ripped
out, so the writer the cases exercise is always ``NativeWorkbook``. The
``native_workbook`` fixture replaces the old ``dual_workbook``: it
constructs a plain ``Workbook()`` and yields it together with the output
path stem; the test populates the workbook, calls ``save()``, and the
written xlsx feeds into single-file structural and semantic checks
(openpyxl serves as the soft secondary oracle).
