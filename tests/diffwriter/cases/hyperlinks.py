"""Hyperlink cases — external URL + internal sheet-local target.

Both external and internal targets exercise the rels-rId resolution that
``xml_tree.normalize`` performs. The Layer 2 diff is meaningful here only
because the rId rewrite is in place — without it, oracle and native would
allocate different rId numbers for the same logical hyperlink.
