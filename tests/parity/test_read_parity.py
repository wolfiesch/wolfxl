"""Per-fixture read parity: open the same xlsx with openpyxl and wolfxl, diff.

Each xlsx fixture produces one test case. The test walks every sheet, every
populated cell, and compares:

* HARD dimensions — any mismatch fails the test.
* SOFT dimensions — recorded in ``ratchet.json``; never allowed to increase.
* INFO dimensions — reported but not gated.

Defined names, merged cells, and sheet dimensions are also diffed once per
workbook.

Large fixtures (>10k populated cells) are capped at the first 10k cells
visited to keep CI wall-clock bounded — the goal is per-row determinism, not
exhaustive byte-for-byte verification on megabyte-scale files.
