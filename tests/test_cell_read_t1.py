"""T1 PR1 — cell-level read parity for comments and hyperlinks.

openpyxl builds the fixture file; wolfxl reads it back. Any divergence
in the cross-library contract (missing field, wrong type, silent None)
surfaces here rather than deep in a user script.

Tests also pin the lazy-caching contract: the Rust reader must be hit
exactly once per sheet no matter how many cells we probe. This prevents
silent regressions where somebody accidentally swaps the dict lookup
for a per-cell FFI call.
