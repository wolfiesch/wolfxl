//! WolfXL — surgical xlsx patcher.
//!
//! Instead of parsing the entire workbook into a DOM (like openpyxl or umya),
//! WolfXL opens the xlsx ZIP, queues cell changes in memory, and on save:
//!   1. Patches only the worksheet XMLs that have dirty cells
//!   2. Patches sharedStrings/styles only if needed
//!   3. Raw-copies all other ZIP entries unchanged
//!
//! This makes modify-and-save O(modified data) instead of O(entire file).
