"""openpyxl-compatible ``wolfxl.cell`` namespace.

Re-exports the rich-text shims from :mod:`wolfxl.cell.rich_text`,
the cell-class compatibility shims (:class:`MergedCell`,
:class:`WriteOnlyCell`), :class:`IllegalCharacterError` (RFC-059 —
Pod 1E), and the array / data-table formula shims from
:mod:`wolfxl.cell.cell` (RFC-057 — Pod 1C).  The package shape
mirrors openpyxl's ``openpyxl.cell`` so existing code that imports
from ``openpyxl.cell.*`` can be redirected to ``wolfxl.cell.*`` with
one-line import swaps.

Pod 2 (RFC-060) owns the openpyxl-shaped path shims (e.g.
``wolfxl.cell.cell``) — this module exposes the classes at their
natural locations and Pod 2 builds the import paths on top.
