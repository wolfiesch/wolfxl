"""Public exception types — openpyxl-shaped hierarchy.

User code that catches openpyxl's typed exceptions (notably
``IllegalCharacterError`` and ``CellCoordinatesException``) needs
the same names from wolfxl when migrating.  We mirror openpyxl's
type names but **do not** subclass openpyxl's hierarchy — the
classes are independent.  Both ``IllegalCharacterError`` and
``CellCoordinatesException`` subclass :class:`ValueError` so
existing ``except ValueError`` callsites keep working unchanged.

The internal raise sites (``utils/cell.py``,
``wolfxl.load_workbook``, the cell value setter) chain via
``raise X(msg) from e`` so the original cause is preserved on
``__cause__`` for callers that introspect it.

Reference: ``openpyxl.utils.exceptions`` (openpyxl 3.1.x).

class InvalidFileException(Exception):
    """Raised when :func:`wolfxl.load_workbook` is asked to open
    something that isn't a valid xlsx / xlsb / xls / encrypted

    The format detector looks at leading magic bytes; anything
    that doesn't match a known archetype surfaces as this
    exception.  Mirrors openpyxl's
    ``openpyxl.utils.exceptions.InvalidFileException``.

    Note: this is a plain :class:`Exception`, not a
    :class:`ValueError` — openpyxl's contract is the same.
    Existing wolfxl callsites that previously raised generic
    ``ValueError`` for unknown file formats are rewrapped to this
    type with ``from`` chaining for backward compatibility.

class IllegalCharacterError(ValueError):
    """Raised when a cell value contains characters illegal in
    OOXML strings.

    The OOXML spec rejects the C0 control characters
    ``\\x00`` – ``\\x08``, ``\\x0B``, ``\\x0C``, ``\\x0E`` –
    ``\\x1F``, plus ``\\x7F``.  Tab (``\\x09``), newline
    (``\\x0A``), and carriage return (``\\x0D``) are allowed.
    Surrogates are also rejected because Excel's serializer
    cannot round-trip them.

    Subclasses :class:`ValueError` so callers using ``except
    ValueError`` continue to function — code that wants the more
    specific type can switch to ``except IllegalCharacterError``.
    Mirrors openpyxl's
    ``openpyxl.utils.exceptions.IllegalCharacterError``.

class CellCoordinatesException(ValueError):

    Triggered by the
    :func:`wolfxl.utils.cell.coordinate_to_tuple`,
    :func:`wolfxl.utils.cell.range_boundaries`, and
    :func:`wolfxl.utils.cell.column_index_from_string` parsers.

    Mirrors openpyxl's
    ``openpyxl.utils.exceptions.ReadOnlyWorkbookException``.

    Note: kept as a plain :class:`Exception` (not
    :class:`RuntimeError`) for openpyxl name parity even though
    wolfxl's existing read-only setter raises ``RuntimeError``
